They followed you out of harbor and setup and ambush with their entire fleet. If they sink your ship you'll be captured and hung, but if you escape, the Royal Navy will never be a problem again. Escape the ships at all costs or sink them all.

These guys are captained by veterans, they've taken down some good pirates and one of them has the peg leg of your dead best pirate friend, they're shots are accurate, they can take you down in one shot no matter what your shield is, these guys will earn you more pirate respect for taking them down
