## Object of the game

You are a pirate sailing back from plundering some islands, you have the booty, you just need to sail your ship back to your hideout. The Royal Navy has other plans for you. They followed you out of harbor and setup and ambush with their entire fleet. If they sink your ship you'll be captured and hung, but if you escape, the Royal Navy will never be a problem again. Escape the ships at all costs or sink them all.

These guys are captained by veterans, they've taken down some good pirates and one of them has the peg leg of your dead best pirate friend, they're shots are accurate, they can take you down in one shot no matter what your shield is, these guys will earn you more pirate respect for taking them down, 6282028240608 points to be accurate, although the ship isn't tons better because it still only takes 2 shots to sink. These guys will only show up once the rookies fail to take you out for 2 levels.
