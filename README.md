# Sea War

## Object of the game

You are a pirate sailing back from plundering some islands, you have the booty, you just need to sail your ship back to your hideout. The Royal Navy has other plans for you. They followed you out of harbor and setup and ambush with their entire fleet. If they sink your ship you'll be captured and hung, but if you escape, the Royal Navy will never be a problem again. Escape the ships at all costs or sink them all.
